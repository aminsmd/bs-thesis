I don\\'t think it\\'s the caffeine, but one way you can figure out if it\\'s caffeine is to try black or green tea (both are from the same plant). I know it seems like there shouldn\\'t be a risk, since they are steaming, then drying to keep the leaves green. So, I\\'m not sure where the lead comes from. But, black tea doesn\\'t carry the same risk. Hardest food allergy/intolerance to break when you adore the smells of coffee :( But at the same time frustrating if I have really consumed these things for over 20 some years not knowing it was causing these symptoms and never putting the two together. Now it looks like herbal tea and rooibos tea are my only options. I think you\\'re right. It doesn\\'t really surprise me that you are so attracted to the smell of coffee, even though you are clearly allergic to it. I\\'ve learned a few years ago that often both people and pets tend to crave the very things they are allergic or sensitive to. I know that this is true even of my cat. She might beg, but she begs politely instead of trying to take something. When I saw that this happens even with the cat, I knew that what I had read about craving things one is allergic to is true and it can\\'t be just psychological. There is likely a psychological connection, but it seems that there must be a physical connection, too, since the cat does this somewhat if something is really rich, like muffins, which I haven\\'t had in forever since I haven\\'t figured out how to make gluten free. It costs a little more than normal cheap dogwoods/catfoods but has really been worth it for them. I think after a while you do actually start to feel more displeasure from the stuff you crave. That\\'s a good resource for dog owners to know about. I don\\'t personally have a dog, but so many people do, so it\\'s greatly appreciated that you posted that information. lol Definitely a challenge for me. Everyone always says try herbal teas, but yes they are not quite the same. You get used to having something and it\\'s hard to let go of it. Glad you enjoyed the link, I had to do a lot of research to get to that myself so love to share it when it applies :D. Since coffee is roasted, the protein must be in the roasted bean. I don\\'t know if this is right or not, but it seems like I remember there being a common protein or a common natural chemical in both coffee and chocolate. You are both right actually I was reading about this recently as well that it is actually the protein in the coffee that causes this. I\\'m really glad to hear of others with the same issue. It makes me feel better. If you notice feeling sick after eating other nickel-high foods (beans, chocolate, peas, whole wheats), or if you react when wearing cheap jewlry, you may want to get tested for nickel allergy. Another note...tea is also high in nickel and fish....you should get tested for allergies... If you recently got cavities filled, a surgery...you should look into a metal allergy. Melisa.org has many great resources to educate about metal allergy. That\\'s a good resource. Plus, several of us have chronic illnesses, so this might be a contributing factor. Great resource betbri, I never knew about metal allergies. Nor did I realize it has a high content of nickel in it. That is very interesting indeed. I did read up on some of the vapors that can be given off from amalgam fillings and was astonished. I have a few that still need to be replaced, but better than the many I had in there. So I will list them and hope it helps you two, and possibly someone else reading this :) Doctors are very much unaware of metal allergies in the US (versus other countries that have done loads of research and some countries test every patient for metal allergy before putting fillings, implants in). You can test allergic to foods that contain metals (brocolli, chocoate, whole wheat, etc...) and again, it may be that you\\'re allergic to those food because of a metal or additive added....so if a person is allergic to multiple foods it\\'s important to rule out the possibility of a common element in all of them. It has been a harsh reality to release that you have to be your own advocate, and that doctors many times don\\'t test for things for those with chronic issues that can\\'t pinpoint exacty what\\'s wrong. it\\'s very unlikely that a doctor would order a whole battery of testing to rule out the many many illnesses that could cause these things. So....please....if you are a person that has skin reactions when you wear certain jewelry, or have chronic acne and rash on face from makeup (which contains high amounts of metal), or react when eating food high in metal content (nuts, many veggies, coffe....) then please do yourself a favor and order the Melissa test yourself! A doctor will literally look at you like you\\'re nuts or a hypocondriac if you tell him/her that you think you\\'re allergic to metal. So ... even though it\\'s a harsh reality, it seems that especially those with chronic, multiple ailments have to be their own advocate and in my case (and I\\'m assuming for others) take matters into our own hands after being told by docts that there\\'s nothing wrong and \"it may be just normal for you to be tired\"....Sorry for the crazy long post! But I hope these few facts help someone else out there, to shorten their road to recovery because it took me so long to figure this out! Probably the best place for anyone to start... And yes we do have to be our own advocates. We have to pay attention to what we ingest and encounter and if it does cause an issue, we need to stay away from it. If only caffeine was easy to stay away from :( This is interesting to me about the mineral make-up. What I\\'m wondering is if the milder reaction I get from the cheap ear wires is more of a sensitivity to nickel and other cheaper metals, or is it something else? you could be a great help to those you know who are getting reactions to jewelry... A large number of people allergic to metals are allergic to multiple types of metal....so a reaction to just cheap jewelry probably indicates a nickel allergy. For some reason I thought that I should make sure...turns out there is a very high metal content! I don\\'t understand why doctors assume that a skin allergy to metals isn\\'t serious enough to consider that taking the stuff internally would still be bad. I will definitely be on guard and not allow any metal devices to be inserted in my body, since I have sensitivities. What is comical and also something to think about is when you get dental work done. I can\\'t figure it out and it\\'s driving me crazy! I guess I have the extreme end then. So far, for me there does seem to be a strong parallel between consuming dairy products from a cow and\\xa0asthma (and phlegm). There is very little online about the type of coffee allergy I\\'ve been experiencing but in doing some initial research, it looks like this is developing over time and perhaps its not an actual caffeine allergy as it is something to do with the coffee or it\\'s processing methods. I think more research needs to be done in this area.. If you have gluten problems then it is very likely that the protein found in coffee is causing you the problems! You may not be able to digest the protein in coffee that is similar to the protein found in gluten. I love coffee and this was very disappointing for me! I am 99% sure the culprit is Tyramine, which is a natural amine found in all foods but much higher in foods that are aged, fermented, pickled\\xa0\\xa0( salami, cheese, sauerkraut, smoked salmon, anchovy paste ), in foods that have been stored for a long time ( nuts, dried fruits) and also in overripe fruits like bananas, oranges and avocados. Soon hopefully I will feel strong enough to start reintroducing these foods into my diet in very small quantities to get myself desensitized, unless of course one day I wake up free of this strange condition that appeared for no reason and might disappear the same way. I guess what is very puzzling to me is the fact that this sensitivity appeared out of the blue, that the symptoms are so violent and that I DO NOT get migraines. So I guess now my goal is to put the word out and ask as many persons as possible is they have ever heard of a patient with the same symptoms, which is why I posted this text. I think tyramine effects glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity. Congratulations on finding the culprit causing your symptoms! According to doctor he expect me to go back to normal life after 12 to 24 months. i wished i would have learned about it sooner. Through my research I have found that gluten intolerance is actually a part of tyramine intolerance, so I recommend that you also eat a gluten free diet. I am healthy eater - or so I thought. Not sure about decaf. Aged meats such a salami, pepperoni bacon, jerky, sausage, hot dogs should be avoided. Tyramine sensitivity can only be treated by diet - I wonder if it ever goes away. As furballsmom stated: Gluten may be an issue. Perhaps I drank too much of it and got some kind of Tyramine Overload. So, once you have eliminated these foods from your diet, the rest might be considered \"safe\". But don\\'t bet on it. The question also led me here in the hope to get more answers..... I am scared of worse symptoms next time, but I absolutely love my fish and Oysters. Folks\\' allergies can change every five years, so, this is probably the case with you. Hopefully, one day, this will pass and you will be able to eat these foods again. I had a suspicion as I was reading your post that you had shellfish allergies due to your intolerance of the iodine bath they gave you before your surgery, this is a dead give-away normally. hi, I\\'m not really sure if it\\'s an shellfish allergy. I guess it could be a histamine intolerance. But try it out and eat some tomatos, if you get the same symptoms you should go to your allergist and make an blood test. Could it be that my body is just acting out now and that I should avoid anything fishy? Fish and Shellfish allergy and I am really bummed as I love fish! Sorry to hear that. Folks\\' allergies can change every five years, so, this is probably the case with you. Hopefully, one day, this will pass and you will be able to eat these foods again. I had a suspicion as I was reading your post that you had shellfish allergies due to your intolerance of the iodine bath they gave you before your surgery, this is a dead give-away normally. Now I\\'m just completely at a lost what is causing this. Sounds like the start to my 5 year long mystery experience. I think others have mentioned, and not too sure if you have done so but I highly recommend the allergen blood panel testing. As for the prednisone .....I would highly recommend an alternative. Supposedly it does more harm than good. well, sounds like a fish or shellfish allergy, you may ask a specialist, sorry about that! :/ I deathly afraid of having an severe allergic reaction that could be life threatening I would go to the doctor who administered the allergy test and ask him or her the questions you have asked here. I don\\'t know if the scale is still the same , but I suspect it is. When you do hear from your allergist, I would request a follow up appointment to discuss the results of your allergy test. If you have a 4 to a specific food, I would eliminate that food from your diet . As for your allergy to oranges, I would discuss this with your allergist as well as your allergy to eggs. You can\\'t be too careful with allergies. If you allergy shots are just for tree pollen and other pollons, it\\'s probably cheaper for you to take an antihistamine like Claritin and more effective. As for your food allergies, If you are allergic to tomatoes, pork, milk, milk products, almonds , chocolate and oranges, I think it\\'s a good idea to just eliminate these foods from your diet. If you allergy shots are just for tree pollen and other pollons, it\\'s probably cheaper for you to take an antihistamine like Claritin and more effective. As for your food allergies, If you are allergic to tomatoes, pork, milk, milk products, almonds , chocolate and oranges, I think it\\'s a good idea to just eliminate these foods from your diet. I hope this comment makes sense. Possibly shrimp, light soy sauce. Going crazy. If you haven\\'t been to an allergist for an allergy test, based on your comments, I would make an appointment with an allergist asap. Till you know what you\\'re allergic to, I would stay away from soy sauce and any other soy products, walnuts, eggs, all peppers and paprika, maybe shrimp too until you\\'ve had your allergy test. It was quite an expense for they want you to keep coming. Hello Debby, I\\'m wondering could you be allergic to the prednisone? Dose anyone know if this is an allergic reaction to what I am eating or could it possible be something wrong with my GI track? Any suggestions on what this might be or any known treatments would be greatly appreciated. I am planning on going to a doctor but do not know what kind of doctor to go to for this predicament? Keep us updated on this, I\\'m certainly curious what you find out or discover. Hi, I\\'d probably see an allergist because although I\\'m not a doctor, my children have anaphylaxis to different foods and what you describe may have been a life-threatening situation. I didn\\'t know the allergies could get that bad. I\\'m scared to eat meat now. Also- thank you for the tip about the epi-pen- my boyfriend said something about me carrying one too, I think that is defiantly something I will have to get - I defiantly don\\'t want to have to go to the ER with a relapse symptom. When you get oral swelling, it can be very serious. Good Luck -- glad you were able to stop back to get some info here. So maybe check some of the things that you ate or see if this is something that has been an ingredient that bothers you. It seems to help her quicker than the tablets. I did not know that Benadryl could help with food allergies, that is great to know. You know, I think a lot of times, for me at least, it is all the \"additives\" they are putting into our food. There are so many \"chemicals\" now, and no one really knows if they are allergic to them until it is too late. Oh, yes, Benadryl really will help. Benadryl really helps with this, too. I hadn\\'t thought of buying the liquid, but even the adult pills will work for me. I have to stick with what I can afford, but I do understand the reasoning for the liquid. Benadryl works much better than Zyrtec and Clariten which are better suited, as I understand and told to me by my kids, for seasonal and indoor allergies v food. I believe solving this problem is key to restoring my health. Any help or direction would be greatly appreciated. Hi, From your long history it seems that due to long suffering of the disease you have got Anxiety neurosis causing all problems. Go for routine check up for thyroid and adjust the dose of medicine accordingly. Once thyroid is all right your most of the symptoms will go. If you have still problem you consult psychiatrist for anxiety neurosis. Any other suggestions would be greatly appreciated. An allergy specialist might be able to help you. You can start by maintaining a food dairy and record those specific items that are inducing your symptoms. This will help to narrow down the search. He may identify the allergen by skin testing and help to desensitize you. Thank you for your advice and I appreciate your interest in helping to identify this mystery. Dr. thinks maybe parasites are robbing her of nutrients. We should have results back in a couple of weeks. Organic apples usually are okay, and all others are not which makes us really wonder about pesticides in her case. When you mention the bag of antibiotics, this is a long shot -- but, can you find the manufacturer of the two bags and see if one contained latex and the other did not? If she happens to be severely latex allergic, that type of allergy can cross-react into dozens of foods and be hidden in products. Just a thought if they didn\\'t do a RAST test for Latex. It\\'s very frustrating when it is trial and error like this I am sure. We\\'ll keep doing a nightly research and hope to find an answer. We certainly appreciate your comments and suggestions. I am certainly at a loss for a solution so I do hope you find out something more soon. I\\'m not sure, but I would definitely begin with asking your doctor if the tubing is latex or latex free .. It may be allergies. We always passed it off as heartburn and not something more, but yes now I am wondering if its actually an allergy. When I think allergy I think swollen face or throat or watery eyes and sneezing. I don\\'t always think of heartburn lol\\xa0I\\'m glad to hear someone else has experienced this too. Oh my, yes, food allergies are not just the \"anaphylatic shock\" They can show themselves in so many forms, it is unbelievable. This is one reason they are so difficult to diagnose. Thanks so much for posting that--- and you are so right when I think food allergy I commonly think throat swelling up or rash. I\\'m going to have to start keeping a food journal of trigger foods. I am curious do you notice that eating too much meat adds to the Heartburn or GI issue along with your allergies? It was the best thing ever, our family loved it. I have never liked milk even when I was little it was always just something that made me cringe, so definitely had to find an alternative. But I agree with others, it seems to be when I am eating foods that I am intolerant too. And what is interesting is this can go beyond normal foods--- I got heartburn the other day from chewing a gum that had aspartame in it, that was awful! I can\\'t help but wonder if it is the preservatives in foods and or products that react to the body in such a way. It doesn\\'t surprise me at all that Aspartame gives you heartburn. Consider yourself fortunate in a way about the Aspartame allergy, because it will discourage you from using something that is harmful to your health. Conventional medicine would write this off and say that GERD is simply the over production of stomach acid. Well, actually, that\\'s over-simplifying GERD. I took the Benadryl, because it\\'s better than reaching for the PPI meds that shut off the stomach acid and are so bad for a person\\'s health when used long-term. If you\\'re close enough to get to Trader Joe\\'s, they have the most affordable rice pasta you can find. I find the rice pasta to be better than the rice tortillas or the rice breads, because the rice tortillas and the rice bread tend to crumble apart. They don\\'t taste bad, but they do fall apart. I don\\'t think it\\'s just one ingredient that bothers me. I had no idea about the latex :(\\xa0I love Dr. Mercola site and the free newsletter that they send out, it\\'s very helpful. I always cross reference his articles with Dr. Weil, he is another favorite of mine. It sounds to me like there was something very wrong with the pineapple you ate yesterday morning. I would call your family doctor , tell them what is going on and make an emergency appointment. Hi again, That\\'s what I thought PCP stood for but wasn\\'t sure. I think it is a good idea that you are going to see your family doctor about this. Oh! Bad pineapple. Not sure what\\'s happening. pls go and see an doctor for testing intolerances like fructose and histmaine. As soon as you get tested positive to histamine, I really can recommend Daosin. It\\'s easy to take. That\\'s it, you\\'ll be fine with that. I thought I\\'d kick off a very short post about latex allergies. If you\\'ve ever eaten these foods, and have a funny \"tingly\" feeling in your mouth, or rash around your mouth after eating them, mention this to your doctor the next time you go. You may be latex-sensitive. Here is a good website on Cross Reactions (Latex - Food) I have in my bookmarks. I find that to be very interesting. I would strongly suggest your allergist tests for latex via blood (not skin) ... bet you my bottom dollar (although I\\'m not a doctor) she will show + to latex to some degree with her history. But, I hope not. If she is + avoidance is the key element to latex -- it never really gets better --\\xa0it can get worse with repeated exposure. And a medic tag is really important in emergency and/or hospital settings with latex all around. Hindsight 20/20 we should have used the epi pen. Oh man, silly me --- I missed the first word in your dd\\'s allergies LATEX! Yes, a condom \"incident\" can be awful. You\\'re right about it being a huge food group. You\\'re right, this pretty much wipes out the fruit category. Citrus is one of the worst ones as far as the blisters inside of the mouth. I\\'ll bet most of our food sensitivities are exactly the same because of that definite allergy to birch. It\\'s funny how the food sensitivities tests all have come back negative, even though I know I have bad reactions to these foods and will be sick. WOW ...I have to say I\\'ve learned a lot from these posts and have been dealing with latex allergy for 8 yrs now! I really really hope this will not affect my career! Interesting that some of you mention Xylitol as well. I wonder if there is a link. You may want to have him tested (via blood) to know  because repeated expsosure must be limited or else it can get worse. Glad the dentist uses non-latex gloves, but with his history,it\\'s probably best to know for sure. So should I also be concerned about my egg intake too? Hi Seattle, WOW ..that\\'s scary. I\\'d be sure to stay away from shrimp and anything that shrimp comes in contact with including other shellfish. Definitely see an allergist for some skin and RAST tests to help identify your allergy and any other unknown possibilities, too. Iodine and shellfish I think are similar. Not a bad idea to carry a medic card and wear a medic tag in case of emergency and unable to speak re your allergy to the shrimp. Yep, unfortunately 3 days sounds about right .. if your rash persists you may want to see your Dr for prednisone added to your regime :( Your system sounds like its still reacting long after the allergen has been ingested. What you describe can manifest into an anaphylactic reaction with future/repeated exposure .. I\\'d see an Allergist ASAP or your family doc at the very least to obtain an Epi Pen prescription and carry two with you .. it\\'s scary. Hang in there and others may have info for you re eggs .. am not sure on that at all. The cocktail sauce may contain horseradish which is in the mustard family --- watch for future mustard family ingestions. Also, maybe use our food diary to track what you eat and reactions. Yeah I definitely have to look into the eggs aspect and a concern with the iodine for future medical history. I don\\'t think it is the horseradish because I have even used that alone on sandwiches as a spread. Geez learn something new about my body all the time and I guess this is just one of them. It\\'s getting better just amazing that it takes a while to get out of your system. I hate taking stuff :( So I am glad you posted about rebound reactions because yes sure enough my welts have returned, not as bad as they first were but they returned. And, since krill are also a related crustacean, you won\\'t want to supplement with krill oil either, even though it\\'s supposed to be superior to fish oil in the way of animal based omega 3 fatty acids. Now, I\\'m scared to eat crustaceans myself. It\\'s more of a food sensitivity, which is why I\\'m aware of the cross reactions. It\\'s all the more important for you with a true allergy. I would continue to take the Benadryl every 6 hours or so until you reach a point of real relief. I believe ChitChatNine said about three days. So, clearly, you\\'re out of the woods, so to speak, but I would keep taking the Benadryl for a couple more days. Don\\'t panic that you see the word \"crisis\" in the address. This is what makes us such a special community .. really helping each other! Furball thank you that was perfect information! Good point on the Krill Oil I would have never thought about that also being included in the list. I am definitely glad there are so many resources here in the Seattle area. It may help to maintain a food dairy and keep monitoring your symptoms. Further allergic testing may be worth looking into. Thanks Paderla for the comment, I definitely think that I need to look into some of these reactions after my pregnancy. Right now I would be afraid to have any allergy testing performed in case there was something I had a severe reaction to. But yes keeping a food diary I think is the safest bet. To the best of my knowledge, as a side note, latex is rarely given subcutaneous to test, to those with documented allergy. I have been reading more and more into my allergies to get a better understanding of them so this certainly helps :D. is anything serious please tell me i\\'am very much worried . Please take my advice and call your Doctor to reschedule the FNA biopsy ASAP so you can have peace of mind. Believe me, knowing what\\'s going on is much better than not knowing and worrying about it needlessly. Please take my advice and call your Doctor to reschedule the FNA biopsy ASAP so you can have peace of mind. Believe me, knowing what\\'s going on is much better than not knowing and worrying about it needlessly. Thank you so much......you are an Angel. i\\'m scared but will try my best for FNAC.....thanks again. That\\'s a very wise decision! pls lemme know as em very much worried... If you aren\\'t willing to follow your Doctor\\'s advice regarding the necessary testing we cannot offer any further help or advice for you here. Unless you have had another Ultrasound test there is no way for you to know whether you have the same lump or not. Obviously you are still not willing to do as your Doctors have advised since you seem to be coming up with any excuse not to have the recommended biopsy. do you think FNAC is must because i dont feel any lump from outside. Japdip has already advised you that if your Radiologist recommended a biopsy, you should, by all means, follow his/her advice ASAP to make sure that there is nothing serious. Believe me that you will feel much better knowing what this lump represents than not knowing. This lump could be anything and not necessarily breast cancer. Please understand that we are not doctors and if we can\\'t answer your questions it\\'s because we simply don\\'t know what else to say except to have the biopsy. Hi, I am so sorry you are going through this difficult time waiting for a biopsy,but as you well know, only a biopsy can tell for sure what is going on. Having \"washout kinetics\" makes it suspicious, but you could still end up with benign results. Hang in there and we hope that your biopsy procedure will go smoothly and results in benign findings. Hi, I am so sorry to hear about your diagnosis. I know finding out that we have breast cancer is scary and overwhelming but don\\'t be discouraged. Your team of Doctors will plan treatments designed specifically for you and hopefully they will be successful in achieving complete recovery. Hoping that the biopsy done on your left breast will result in benign findings. Zouzi , thank you for giving such wonderful support to rumpled and all your members on the community. I am so sorry about your diagnoses. I know how scary it is, and how alone you can feel. Your doctors will come up with a great plan, and you will beat this! As I have been told more than once \"Fight Like A Girl!\" :) I really hope \"rumpled\" will be just fine once her treatments start. Really bummed... It\\'s rather unusual to have cancer in both breasts, but unfortunately it can occur and I am really sorry that this happened to you. Even if you are one of the few women to experience cancer bilaterally, the scenario isn\\'t as dire as it sounds. The good thing is that the tumor in your right breast is rather small and is ER/PR positive which will respond well to medication, such as Tamoxifen or other similar drugs to lower considerably the risk of recurrence. The tumor in your left breast is Grade 1 which is also a good thing. It\\'s going to be a long journey but don\\'t be disheartened. Take one step at a time, follow your Doctor\\'s recommendation and I am sure you\\'ll be able to beat this disease like many of us did. Wishing you all the best and successful outcome. I could have done the lumpectomy but with my history and the placement of the tumors, I would have been very lopsided so the double is a better choice and I may avoid radiation which can also be a better choice (I need it elsewhere and trying to avoid as much as I can). I am sure that your Doctors will explain all this to you in details, when you\\'ll meet them. i am sorry to hear about your diagnoses. Hi, I imagine you are busy, and at least a bit overwhelmed, with all the tests, appointments, etc., in preparation for your surgery. Here is a link to an old thread that has been helpful to many members and may provide a few useful tips for you as well: Wishing you all the best, bluebutterfly. I know it seems so overwhelming, but you will get through this, I promise. Again, please, feel free to ask anything about my journey. May be a tug (thigh). Please make sure (As suggested by Sue Young in the PM I sent you) that this is a specialized surgery and should be performed by experienced plastic surgeons who have done numerous Diep Reconstruction Surgeries. I am glad you have a surgery date. One day and step at a time. If you need support, leading up to, and after surgery please know we are here for you. Waiting is the worst... The surgeons (three of them) are skilled in minor surgery and have done many diep and tram surgeries so I feel I am in good hands. Yes I know�the waiting is very stressful, but try not to get discouraged! Please remember that \"Positive thinking leads to positive outcomes\" The important thing here is that you have found Doctors who are very experienced with this type of surgery, and especially knowing that you are in good hands. I am sure you\\'ll be just fine and these difficult times will be over sooner than you think! For sure I am getting the DIEP which is nice. I am hoping I can keep him calm somehow! Hi there, Thank you for the update and I am glad to know that all the tests you have had so far, are fine and that you\\'ll have DIEP breast reconstruction. It\\'s understandable that you are feeling nervous right now!but as soon as things get rolling, all will go well and you\\'ll feel much better. I also hope you won\\'t need chemo!we know it\\'s not easy to go through this therapy, but if Oncologists recommended it, it\\'s very important to follow their advice because it does save lives. I hope you have read Sue Young\\'s info about post-op care that I sent you a few weeks ago (Link below) When you are well prepared and know what to expect, I am sure your recovery will be quicker than you think. I am so sorry to hear about your diagnosis. At least you have a good idea of what to expect, after reading Sue Young\\'sexcellent post about preparing for bilateral mastectomy (the link for which I providedin my 10/17/15 comment, above). I certainly understand your nervousness; it\\'s a lot to deal with, right down to \"pet parent\" concerns. (Do you have someone who can help \"babysit\" your one cat, to try to keep him calm until things are back to normal?) I\\'m glad to hear you will be able to have the DIEP reconstruction! Know that many thoughts and prayers will be with you. His sister is calm. :/ I am just hoping we can work around him. Hi again, Actually, I meant would someone be staying with you at first who might be able to calm him at least a little when he wants to be in your room and can\\'t be. By the way, by my comments I don\\'t mean to suggest you haven\\'t already thought of every possible thing, esp.knowing your pet so well. I just hate to think of your having to worry a lot about him at the same time you are going through everything . I am happy that your tumor is stage one, but sorry to know that you experienced a few complication after your surgery. I hope that you are doing better now and hopefully medication will take care of the infection and fever soon. I also hope that your Oncotype test will be low ( 18 or less) indicating that there is a much lower chance that the breast cancer will return and most probably chemotherapy won\\'t be necessary. P.S. Your cat seemed to discern that you were not feeling your best and he is indeed a very good pet! I again would prefer to just leave it alone. I would NOT just leave it alone and I can\\'t imagine why anyone would choose to do this. 5% may not seem much of a chance to you but even a 1% chance would send me to a Breast Surgeon immediately. You can do whatever you feel comfortable with but since there has been growth give it some more thought before you decide to ignore this condition. Even if you do see a Breast Surgeon there is a chance that he/she may agree with waiting and doing close interval testing and the choice will still be yours and yours alone. It is scary but for me i feel maybe it would just be better to follow this and see if there is a change. Great to hear that you are going to keep seeking a definite answer. I\\'m all for second opinions and I believe that a person should keep seeking information until they are comfortable with all the answers. When I hear \"don\\'t worry about it\" I always want to know \"WHY\" I shouldn\\'t worry :) Always appreciate follow-ups .... Thanks. I think you made the right choice, for sure! Better safe then sorry! Cancer if left untreated can be extremely dangerous and even fatal. I don\\'t necessarily think that conventional medicine has all the answers. Some people have had really amazing results with lifestyle medicine. You need to do what feels right to you. Intuition is a valuable tool. It sounds as though you have found a GREAT Surgeon who has exactly the right information and caring that you need. The follow-up plan seems very appropriate and I would be comfortable with that myself. I do think it wise to go ahead with the second opinion to further clear things in your mind. The hematoma issue isn\\'t at all unusual in such circumstances with biopsies but it can complicate the situation. Remember that the decision you make today or 3 months from now won\\'t necessarily change the outcome. You\\'re on the right track but try not to confuse yourself by doing TOO much research as no 2 cases are the same and you can\\'t depend too much on percentages, they are too general. Take care and stay busy .... NO negative thinking !! My question which i think is important does anyone know? That\\'s too bad that you had a less than comfortable experience with the Breast Surgeon; perhaps she was having a bad day ???? At this point since the chance of a single papilloma being malignant is rather small you might as well follow it for the recommended 6 months. This all began the last of November and you should count the 6 months from that date and see what is recommended at your next check-up which would be in the Spring. If at that time it is determined to be benign then it can be left alone. On the other hand if you are \"done\" with all the re-checks and possible biopsies then have it removed and over with. It all comes down to what you are comfortable with. I would make my appointment now for the 6 month check-up if that\\'s the way you intend to go so there will be no waiting when the time actually arrives. Surgery is better way to go. I know I will be fine but still a little scary. I really don\\'t see any difference in the two. It seems to me that this is just the use of different terminology. Having it removed will give you peace of mind. That does seem rather a long time but it depends upon exactly what your normal activity consists of, like strenuous exercise which would not be wise or several other things that would put undue strain on muscles, etc. I would increase your activities very gradually but NEVER go against the advice of the Surgeon. Complete healing of the tissues does take quite some time and you certainly would not want to delay that. I\\'m glad to hear the things went well and hope for GREAT news when the reports come in. Why would they wait! I am so scared! I wouldn\\'t worry so much if I were you, because what your radiologist has recommended is standard procedure. If these calcification were suspicious in any way, I am sure a biopsy would have certainly been ordered. But of course this is up to you to decide!. if you still feel uncomfortable waiting six months for a follow up, you could always have your films read by another Radiologist for a second opinion, or ask your Doctor to order a biopsy. I don\\'t understand why I have to have a mammogram in 6 months. Why can\\'t I just get one in 1 year? I don\\'t think BI RADS 3 is very useful to have to spend the extra money to watch something that is benign. I hope that you\\'ll follow your doctor\\'s recommendation to make sure there is no change in the size, shape or number of calcifications. I have not seen 1 resource where it is recommended that fine, linear calcifications be put in the BI RADS 3 or 2 categories. I wish I could give you more information about the things you are requesting here, but the only advice I can give you is to have your Mammogram films read by a different Radiologist for a second opinion and also to have your test report explained to you in details by your Doctor who is your best source of information. I don\\'t understand if they are not worrisome, why watch them? It seems like a waste of resources. I don\\'t know what else to tell you .. except that monitoring closely \"probably benign\" calcification is standard procedure and in my opinion it\\'s not a waste of resources if we want to make sure that our breasts are healthy and stay healthy. If you are terribly worried about these calcifications, please take my advice and seek a second opinion from a different radiologist who might recommend a biopsy (if necessary) so you can have peace of mind. Just be patient. If you have any concerns make sure you get them checked out. I didn\\'t expect this to happen at all with the healing of the incision. He surely sees it all the time. It\\'s good to be reassured. I am so glad to have this site with all who care so much about one another. Personally I didn\\'t expect to get an infection and definitely didn\\'t anticipate needing district nursing input. It is good if a surgeon doesn\\'t seem concerned -I think. I\\'ve really benefited from this site and the support, advice and information too. It\\'s been invaluable. I expect that section too will heal. I think it\\'s normal for us to become anxious, etc during our recoveries. This is all new to us and we\\'re learning about ourselves and our bodies during this process. Just be vigilant about your breast (without making it worse) and discuss any concerns you have with your doctor. I would suggest you start your own new thread. If you describe the details of your situation and ask your questions there, you will be more likely to get answers addressed specifically to you and your concerns. As far as the packing is concerned, if the area isn\\'t painful at the present then I doubt that it will be terribly uncomfortable. Here\\'s hoping it will be effective and not cause you very much discomfort. Hang in there, these things do happen now and then but they can be overcome with a little extra time. That means cancer,right? Nobody willtellme anything and I amso scared. I am so sorry you aren\\'t getting clear answers. I believe there is a truth in the saying \"No news is good news\". I know it\\'s hard, and nerve wracking, and Damn Scary! But, you can handle this! Maybe take a family member or friend with you to your appts to take notes. I hope you get answers soon!!! I believe I addressed your concerns in my response to your post of July 14th. You need to speak to your Dr. for answers regarding your concerns and I believe I advised this also in my previous response. You evidently have been told quite a lot here as well as from your Dr. and the Radiologist that read your films. Please speak to the Dr.,or his/her Nurse who ordered your tests. They have all your information and know the answers and will be more than happy to explain things to you. As I stated before Cancer cannot be determined until a biopsy is done so be patient and take things one step at a time and ASK questions of the Professionals who are treating you. I\\'m sorry but there is no way that we or your Dr.s can make you remember what you have been told about these circumstances. Perhaps you could ask you family Dr. for some type of medication that would help in calming these fears that you seem to have about cancer. I will try one more time to assure you that the Dr.s certainly are NOT trying to hide anything from you ... For the third time I will say that there are no answers until all your tests have been completed and only a biopsy can diagnose cancer .... not size nor how something looks on film. It also might help if you would call your Dr..s office and ask for a copy of the reports on the tests that have been done so far. Call you Dr. .... ask the Nurse ... read the reports or better yet have them read and explained to you but don\\'t expect answers before there are answers. I am so sorry you aren\\'t getting clear answers. I believe there is a truth in the saying \"No news is good news\". I know it\\'s hard, and nerve wracking, and Damn Scary! But, you can handle this! Maybe take a family member or friend with you to your appts to take notes. I hope you get answers soon!!! Should I be terrified? Too late�I am..help. I see no reason to panic at this point. It could be a Fibroadenoma which is a benign breast tumor. I would be surprised that a mass of this size representing cancer would not have shown up on either the Mammogram or Ultrasound. Proceed with the recommended biopsy which will define more accurately what you\\'re dealing with. Being terrified never helps and usually tends to cloud your vision as well as your thoughts. I imagine that you are seeing a Breast Specialist but if not this is something that you need to arrange. It has become all consuming. You\\'re more than welcome .... it\\'s scary up there on the ledge :) Luck, Wishes and Prayers are with you from all of us here. We know how it is but whatever it is we always seem to be able to handle it. Thanks for the update .... sounds as though you have done well so far and it\\'s a GREAT thing that nodes were not involved. As far as the Chemo goes, it\\'s hard to say. Everyone and their response to the drugs is so varied you\\'ll just have to wait and see .... great advice, right ?? Keep positive thoughts and don\\'t go looking for \"what might occur\" and don\\'t hesitate to make clear any problems you may have. Don\\'t keep it to yourself; make it known if you have a problem of any kind. Wishing you a good experience during your treatment .... you can do it, I know you can !! Take care and keep us posted when you have the time. Considering all the other issues one more scan would be far down on the worry list. I\\'m sure you will be having them after treatment and perhaps routinely for a period of time. Just hang in there; you know it won\\'t be over in a moment .... all things take time and we all have a problem being patient when it comes to WAITING. Do you best, you\\'ve done a SUPER job so far; don\\'t spoil your record .... Take care now. There will seem to be no end to the \"waiting\" but it\\'s all a learning experience. After all is said and done you will be a much more patient person ..... hopefully :) . I thought this would have been protective. Try not to worry....Hopefully this is nothing to be concerned about. I don\\'t think it\\'s a cyst because it\\'s not clear, has calcifications in it :/ that\\'s what the radiologist said to me. I feel too young to have cancer. You are welcome Joanne, I don\\'t think it\\'s a cyst either,I just mentioned that some cysts could also look suspicious What you have is most probably a Fibroadenoma which is a solid lump that needs to be biopsied to make sure that in fact it is a benign lesion,which could also present with calcification and not well circumcised . It\\'s make things seem more probable. Yes,I know that the possibility of \"breast cancer\" can cause a lot of stress and anxiety,but remember that reading stories over the internet about women with BC is not necessarily related to your situation at all,since you haven\\'t been diagnosed with anything yet. Try your best to stay calm and don\\'t let your mind be filled with negative thoughts. Keep in mind that many breast lumps are not cancerous,even suspicious ones...and I hope the same for you too. Please let us know when you receive your biopsy results and lets hope for a favorable outcome. That\\'s a good thing right? I am sure that your Doctor can explain to you in details your complete Ultrasound report. I am sorry if I cannot help you more,but I would advise you to visit your Doctor concerning your Ultrasound results,because he/she would be your best source of information. I think what the doctor is trying to tell you is that surgery in your case is necessary, and which you now say you had. He also said that especially if lymph nodes are involved, chemotherapy is highly recommended and the right way to go in your case. Do not put off chemo because of financial reasons. I think one of them is called youcanthrive.org, or something close to that. Your LIFE is more important than financial considerations. NOBODY in this country should have to risk recurrence of a life threatening disease because they can\\'t afford treatment. Is it true once it reaches the bones it is stage 4? I\\'m so sorry to learn of your Mother\\'s present condition. Evidently she received very poor medical care when her first cancer was discovered. The fact that she now has metastisis to the bone isn\\'t the main issue as bone mets is quite easliy managed. The lymph node involvement is the problem to be addressed first. I truly hope that you are being treated by an Oncologist and that she will not refuse whatever treatment that is recommended. The only proven treatment for cancer at any stage is a combination of Chemotherapy, Radiation and possible Hormone Therapy following the appropriate surgery at the time the cancer is first discovered. As far as prognosis at this point; that would be something you should discuss with your Mother\\'s Oncologist as he/she has all the necessary information regarding the cancer. So sorry to learn of your mother\\'s health.... The first doctor apparently did not do his job aty all. By all means, seek the assistance of a good oncologist -- but listen to his/her recommendations. They will almost always without a doubt recommend the chemotherapy protocol, which has NOT been proven to help the majority of those receiving it (less than 15%). Remember one thing -- and that is an oncologist job is to educate and inform patients only of what they are taught and told to relate to patients. Please do your research for your mother -- it can save her life and give her peace of mind as well as quality of life. I can certainly appreciate your concern and your wish to get concrete answers. I am hoping that this will be true for me and I definitely hope that this will be true for your mother. I hope that this is somewhat helpful. I don\\'t think any one, cancer patient or oncologist, is quick to put a life expectancy in absolute terms. I do understand, however, the wish to have certainty in such a vulnerable situation. I thought you answered her question very well� and I read most all of your replies which are great. You are very knowledgable and helpful to this board. (What\\'s up with that?) They could at least warn a person NICELY and say the rules of the board and not to post OTHER websites or you will be expelled premanetly. so why they would chase someone like me away that is honestly trying to help someone is beyond me. You just posted another website in order to help this person that was very distressed and upset which I think was VERY KIND of you and approperiate considering her circumstances. So I\\'m just curious why they were so quick to kick me off even when I APOLOGIZED for giving this girl the name of a website? I see nothing wrong with someone helping another. I will probably get kicked off for this one too...just watch. why did they just single me out? It\\'s always bothered me that Medhelp jumped on me like that. Hasn\\'t medhelp heard of warnings or telling someone thats not allowed verses just KICK them off the board for good. Sorry...ticks me off. That wasn\\'t fair. My time is valuable to me�important. I just LIKE to HELP people� not cause problems or hurt anyone. I just didn\\'t like that way I was treated. Now I see you post a website and thats ok...but its not for me. Medhelp should only have one set of rules...not a double standard. And believe me...this post is with ALL DUE RESPECT for you. You do good work here!:) I guess I\\'ve been holding this in a long time and life is SHORT...well it will be for me�so I wanted to get this out. Keep up the \"great\" work Japdip... your are fast to respond to everyones questions and that alone is very important. I am so sorry you got another diagnosis of cancer. I am sending prayers your way that you get the correct treatment and that you recover again. And I\\'m sorry you\\'ve had a tough time posting. I value your posts and I believe other women do as well. I do understand why you would offer that website to someone desperate for information and I know your heart is in the right place. (You may want to check into the PARP inhibitor studies going on right now for metastatic breast cancer). Just wanted to pipe in and say I am so glad you are active on this Web site and that I have gotten gotten a lot out of your posts! (I know from personal experience that the rules are applied very unevenly) I am sorry that you are now in Stage 4. so keep positive xx . And it scares me that so many people seem to become so addicted to it, and I\\'m scared that I\\'ll be too tired to be responsible, raise my three year old son, etc... it just seems like once I start this patch, there\\'s no going back! absolutly DO NOT TAKE FENTYNAL PATCHES! I hope your cancer is in remission, by the way--- this all *****. DO NOT TAKE! Its the most horrible pain medicine to come off of. This drug is hell and is not worth it. Stay away! You will thank me! I would definetly do all the research you can on your own before taking anything like this for pain. Just like jessie and shellbell said, these drugs can and will ruin your life. I don\\'t think Doctors really understand how easily a person can go from taking these meds as prescribed to getting way out of control with them. It is devastating what these types of medicines can do. I hope you are able to find something for your pain....nothing worse than hurting all the time. Hi, I\\'m sorry to hear you are having such a pain problem. My concern about the fentanyl patches is that the side effects can continue to increase even though the pain relief effect has begun to diminish. My suggestion would be for you to enroll in a pain clinc, if you have not already done so, so that your pain can be closely monitored and managed by a doctor who is a specialist in this area of medicine. I guess they all died and therefore had to not deal with withdrawal. I don\\'t think it\\'s a \\'feel good\\' drug but incredibly powerful otherwise. Hi, I suggest you go to a pain management group. Please see an expert on pain management. No drug is bad if it keep you from having pain. Wow.I\\'m sorry to see all the misinformation on this thread about the fentanyl patch. That is a huge difference. Please don\\'t live your life in pain if you don\\'t have to. Yes, it can be misused and abused, but so can any other opiate. If you work with your doctor and taper off when you no longer need it, you won\\'t have to worry about withdrawal. Jaybay, you cannot call an opinion coming from personal experience \\'sorry misinformation\\'. Not 100 inserts, or books, or doctor\\'s and/or nurse\\'s advice on fentanyl comes even close to the value of reporting from \\'personal experience\\', and I am impressed that pretty much all of us who have used fentanyl, or had a friend whose experience they are familiar with, has stringly advised against the drug, unless nothing else controls the pain. and fentanyl is not nearly as abused as other narcotics, so it\\'s not \\'the same\\' as all the others, because it is not a \\'feel good\\' drug. Both, providing objective information, preferably with a link attached, and personal experience are what makes a forum like this so valuable to those who want to \\'know\\' something \\'real\\' . I don\\'t want to see anyone suffer this if I can prevent it so PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THEM !!!!!!!!!! I am so sorry to hear what you and your daughter have gone through, and what you are now going through with your current pregnacy! Thank you for sharing your experience, which may be taken into consideration by others. trying to decide about using this treatment. I hope your son will be as happy and healthy as your daughter. It is possible you have Crohn\\'s in the small intestine, which will not show on a colonoscopy, as this only looks at the large intestine (colon). As far as I understand, the only conclusive proof of Crohn\\'s is biopsy of affected tissue, looked at by a pathologist. It is not an IBD auto-immune disease and in my opinion, a lazy diagnosis by doctors who cannot be bothered to do proper evaluations. I don\\'t really understand. That makes no sense to me. It just doesn\\'t make sense to me. I guess I can understand that. Still, I\\'d like to know if I have Crohns or if it\\'s something else, what is it? I hope you get a diagnosis soon. I can understand your frustration. i\\xa0share your opinion of IBS being a lazy diognosis from a doctor ... i just dont think you can be as sick as i\\'ve been and it be that... anyway ,isn\\'t\\xa0it just great when you get better.. Any responses at the jejelum would be appreciated. I would recommend getting a capsule endoscopy. trust me ,when a doctor does a colonoscopy,he goes into the small intestines, most people with crohns has it in the iliuem.i got dignosed with crohns disease in the year 2000,. I really just think there is something much deeper going on here with all these different things going on. Be very insistent, we know our bodies better than any dr out there. If you know something is wrong keep pursuing it. Ask your doctor for a SED rate and CRP blood test. Ask for a genetic test to be done on your blood. The disease ***** but you can control it with a positive attitude, healthy diet and proper medical care. Like you say, you know your own body better than anybody and it upsets me because I know it is something far more serious than that. It gets me down that the doctors are leaving it to IBS because I know this is not the case. It\\'s horrible to think I may go 12 years living like this - it really puts a hold on reality :( thanks for all this advice it makes me feel better that theres people out there in the same position as me. I do not belive that this is my problem. I still don\\'t belive I have crohns but i don\\'t know where to go from here. He wants me to start on meds for crohns and I am not ready to do this. I need more proof. So WHY would I put myself thru that hor-eye-bull prep for a colonoscopy??? I feel bad for everyone that has to deal with this disease i have, \"Ulcerative Colitis\".. So much for the \"patients Bill of Rights\" and or \"Civil Rights\". They have stripped me of my self Dignity knowing full well that stress is already at it\\'s peek level.Total Disregard for a human being under their care. Hopefully some one with Administrative Power will have some morals to correct this nightmare he has inflicted upon me. So much for private health care. its a damn shame one should have to feel intimidated to further their care to recovery through the ones that treated you in the first place. A speedy recovery to all above and beyond. I know something more serious than ibs is going on with me. I pray they figure out what\\'s going on with me! doesn\\'t help! I just want to start on the medication to see if it will help. The doctor decided it was more likely it was just IBS, but I don\\'t think I could be this sick for this long just from IBS. I think you need to find a new GI doctor. It\\'s not ok to blow off a patient. Find one who actually cares about your health and well-being. And insist on a camera endoscopy. I\\'m fairly certain my doctor thinks I have Crohn\\'s even though most of my tests and biopsies have come back negative. Hopefully in another week I\\'ll have my answers. Should I be supper worry? So we need to control our immune and mangosteen skin juice help me (God showed me) I searched a lot and found that cabbage also helped. Control the autoimmune first! Go chek the diseases that caused by autoimmune. if I find out anything different I will be sure to share please do the same I would love to know of any connection. I see no direct link to the illness except that as emg454 mentioned, herpes reacts to stress. When you are in a \"major\" flare up verses the everyday things that come with this illness, and anything else in your life that can be compounding the \"stress situation\" ie..family, kids, work, fear of losing job/medical benefits, possible surgery, ect... it all adds to the stress your body is under while trying to fend off the attack on our immune systems, therefore you could be susceptible to further outbreaks. This is a surgeon in my area he is a very good doctor. I thought I was being punished and was always going to have this health situation, but luckily, I don\\'t. Testing for SIBO is key. It\\'s important to know you have it for sure. I really hope this helps many of you struggling with this. I know it can seem like a hopeless issue and if I can add any other energy to this I\\'d say; please take self-judgement out of the mix. I know, easier said than done but at the end of the day it\\'s just a virus. Self-judgment will only lead to more stress and we don\\'t need more of that. And there is someone out there that will fully accept you the way you are. Stay positive, full of optimism and self-love and don\\'t settle. You can heal these issues. Its horrible. Beautiful down there! i know im young but it just seems like no one wanted to listin to me. but doctors apparently dont like to give pain meds but for people that have these kinda problems it should be necesary for all the people that abuse it now we cant even feel comfortable to ask i was so afraid to ask. people shouldnt be in that kinda pain. i have no faith in them. im hopeing this does help cross my fingers. GO TO A CHIROPRACTOR! DO NOT START WITH PAIN MEDS!! There had to be something better than being on pain medication. THIS WAS THE BEST DECISION OF MY LIFE! Remember: You have nothing to lose by going to the chiropractor first. Those should be your VERY LAST options! I hate it. I think its a wicked disease that no one really understands and if you don\\'t have it you don\\'t really understand the pain that is involved with crohns. I hope my story can help those who have had these problems with Crohns. I don\\'t think anyone will find a cure as of yet but time will come and maybe there will be light at the end of the tunnel. How stupid of me. My doctor who works in a University setting and is the Founder of the Illinois IBD Society is PISSED. I hope all you guys who are doing well keep well and those of you who are suffering to get better. Insiste on being seen by a rheumatologist and having a complete blood work up and exrays. There are treatments, other pain relief meds, and chiropractor or massage can help but it is important that the cause is treated, not just the symptoms. like the other posters suggested go see a Rhuematologist ASAP. Hope you feel better and hope this helps! like the other posters suggested go see a Rhuematologist ASAP. Hope you feel better and hope this helps! check for ostioporsis. find another doc yr only hope. Has any doctor thought of Fibromyalgia? I am so sorry to read about everyone\\'s pain. I was hoping to find some advice for her, but apparently you folks are just as desperate as she is. I wish you all relief from your pain. I hope someday they will find something that would not kill of something else helping Crohn\\'s. They only suppress the immune system & mask the problem, not the root of the problem: the SAD, toxins, pesticides, etc. poisoning our bodies for yeas. You need to clean up the body to get well and stay well. THE RIGHT FOOD IS MEDICINE. Great resource: www.healingnaturallybybee.com, and don\\'t forget prayer. There is great power in prayer. I feel so bad for you. It is up to us to take control and continue with life. They all need me and I need to be there for them. Medical technology has come so far and even there is no cure yet for our disease I keep the hope. It has been a while since your post and I hope you are doing better as I write this. To all of us suffering, PLEASE never give up. It will get better! I found what you have written interesting. I really want to change my entire diet. Should I keep taking the medication and change my diet at the same time? I am really confused. After researching I dont feel comfortable with trying any of those. It seems that it may help with the crohns but start a whole new diesease to tackle. My husbands co-worker suggested that I should try aloe vera juice. I hope this is the start of a miracle!! If this helps.....Im planting aloe vera all over my yard!!!!! Since I have been there and know what it is like to go through life with crohns and other realted issues, I would like to give a cyber hug to all who are going through this. Breath through the pain and stay positive. Keep researching and dont be shy to vent. Sometimes help comes from the least expected source! Maybe something for you to try. Let me tell you you are in the right step of healing process ALOE VERA? I have herd good things about it. Its a natural medicine sent frm god. I truly beleive in natural remedies cause Im sick of medicine like asacol, Colazol, predisone they just worsen your symptoms. Let me say that I feel great they are miracle workers.. The best of luck to you. I\\'m willing to try anything which is not toxic to my health. Maybe I will go ahead and try it along with aloe vera juice. I\\'m so happy for you! I cant wait to feel better again soon! I appreciate your help and support :) Thanks! Although I felt wierd buying something which is for healthy lactation(since Im not nursing), I want to get the other benefits from fenugreek seeds. Staying hopeful :) Should i buy an aloe vera drink or capsules? If the steriods work I would stay on them until you get your UC under control. If you are not on steriods right now, it would be a good time to try it so you would not have to be taken off of them again. If you are taking any mesalmine (Lialda etc) tablets....I would suggest you keep taking them too. Great not to have the awful side affects of steroids,methotrexate,6mp. ALL OF YOU STAY AWAY FROM THE ALOE VERA ESPECIALLY ANYONE ALLERGIC TO LATEX!! Lactating women should also refrain from consuming aloe vera juice, as it contains anthraquinone which may lead to diarrhea. 6. People, who suffer from irritable bowel syndrome and gastrointestinal problem, should not drink aloe vera juice, as it contains high amount of laxatives which can increase the severity of the problem. Thus, people who are undergoing treatment for hypoglycemia or diabetes should consult their physician before consuming aloe vera juice. Do your research. Talk to your Gastroenterologist. If you aren\\'t being managed by one I strongly suggest going to see one. The best advice I could give is to watch what you eat, make a good diary of what you eat and when and how it makes you feel, also include how it affects your bowel movements. Write down if they are loose or hard, watery, what color it is, if there is an unusually foul smell, or if you notice any blood. Share this information with your doctor. Talk to a nutritionist to help with planning meals to get your vitamins. Hard thing to do when a person has Crohn\\'s. Try to stay regular when it comes to your bowel movements. Try to avoid nuts, fresh fruit and vegetables, whole grains and dairy since lactose intolerance goes hand in hand with Crohn\\'s. Don\\'t let people convince you to try the latest fads around colon cleansing and probiotics. Always consult your doctor first and I can\\'t stress this enough do your research. Get your rest. Drink lots of water. Limit anything with caffeine. Join a support group. Tell them what you deal with. The best we can pray for us to be in remission and symptom free. This is a disease you must be mindful of for the rest of your life. So we need to control our immune and mangosteen skin juice help me (God Jesus showed me) I searched a lot and found that cabbage also helped. Some aloevera helped too.. Control the autoimmune first! Go chek the diseases that caused by autoimmune. I can\\'t take it anymore! I\\'m hoping someone can help me out here. Please, anyone, if anyone out there knows what\\'s wrong, please tell me!! If you find out the answer, I would like to know. Don\\'t be fobbed off with useless doctors telling you that it\\'s caused by stress , that doesn\\'t help you at all does it. Good luck with it , it\\'s not a nice problem to have and there\\'s no real fix for it :-(  . When doctors fail to diagnose an ailment they often ascribe it to \"stress,\" or \"anxiety.\" or \"autoimmune,\" a term growing in popularity. I guess it hurts to say, \"I don\\'t know what is wrong with you.\" Some of those on this forum may be suffering from a pathogen, in which case the most likely culprit is Candida albicans. Candidiasis is an under-diagnosed ailment. You have PROCTITIS, and Tenesmus which is very painful bowel-movements is a symptom of it. The malfunctioning or INJURED nerves cause the immune system to attack JUST like it attacks other areas that are injured like a wrist when you sprain it, an infected cut, an insect bite, etc.. To FIX those nerves you will need an account at swansonvitamins or any other supplement company to BUY:  Tripple Magnesium Complex 400mg/capsule, Balance B-100, Odor controlled garlic 500mg/capsule, Niacinamide 500 mg/capsule, Time-release vitamin c 1000 mg/capsule, vitamin k2, cayenne pepper capsule and any other supplement you feel like you will need like fish oil......... These are Great supplements for the brain and nerves, heart, bones, etc..  for example, google: \"vitamin k2 parkinson\\'s\" or this one: \"vitamin k2 pancreatic cancer\" Start taking vitamin K2 to make sure YOU DON\\'T GET CANCER! Protocol for you to fix those nerves: -take 400 mg magnesium daily. take a B-100 capsule with each meal. take 2 of those 500 mg odor controlled garlic capsules with each meal if you can which comes out to some 6 capsules daily. take at least 4 of those time-release vitamin c 1000 mg capsules daily so that your body can make the collagen that is needed in your skin. You may want to add L-Lysine to your vitamin-c so that your body can make Elastin which is also needed. take 3 vitamin K2 tablets every day and make sure to take a fish pill capsule every time you take a vitamin K2 capsule. You may consider vitamin k1 for this. take 2 of those 500 mg Niacinamide capsules daily, one in the morning and other in evening after supper. experiment with just ONE cayenne capsule if you buy them but be sure to take it after one of your meals. This is a symptom of Magnesium deficiency! Also every time you go to your doctor your Heart rate is constantly above 90-near tachycardia.........This is also an indication of Magnesium deficiency. go to wikipedia and search: \\'hypomagnesemia\\' then look at the symptoms, and I guarantee YOU WILL SEE THAT YOU ARE DEFICIENT IN JUST THIS ONE NUTRIENT! TO fix the Neurons in the colon, you must take alot of these nutrients to counteract the effect of the diahrea so DO NOT DRINK caffeine or Alcohol during this period because these are diuretics and make you urinate alot so you urinate the micronutrients out, and YOU ALREADY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE DIAHREA DEPLETING your body of them. THE key to fixing these nerves is taking a bunch of those micronrutrients in my previous post JUST DO NOT take more than 400 mg of magnesium, any more than that and it will become a Laxative. To get more magnesium in your depleted body, Use Epsom Salt in your bathtub when you take a bath!!!!! Look into LDN for Crohn\\'s.......Buy a odor controlled garlic 500 mg/capsule from swanson because these will help you. taking those garlic tablets is like taking pure SULFUR!!!!! To convince yourself garlic plus all those supplements is what you need go to wikipedia and search \"Humira\" and look at the humira molecule to see all that sulfur...... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humira. Try the garlic supplements to see how much they help with the inflammation, but you better add all the other supplements like I posted before you come down with problems like osteoporosis. Your problems could be from a variety of things. The pain the legs and feet are from nerves but you need to be checked by a Gastrointestinal doc for Crohn\\'s disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease.. If you have any advice please help, I feel lost! So no its not normal. Hi - can only suggest you see a gastro soon and perhaps have an upper endoscopy, and/or small bowel follow through to check for any obstructions which may be causing the vomiting and swallowing problems. What meds are you on for Crohn\\'s? Sudden weight loss of that order really needs to be addressed quickly, as you will be become malnourished. Please keep in touch, its great talking to people who understand what I\\'m dealing with and who understand crohns. We are still learning so much. Thanks for your advice, its much appreciated! Being a glass half full person, I try and find something positive in each and every day now, rather than dwelling on the past, or what may happen in the future. I do my research, am able to talk articulately to my doctors, and just so pleased to be alive, even with a somewhat curtailed lifestyle. Hope you get some relief soon for your symptoms - if I can help in any further way, just let me know. Hi again, just had a thought that may help you. perfect for my small frame and height. Just a thought - many of my bc sisters have also found ginger very helpful in dealing with constant nausea. Do you suggest any meds with little side effects. I hope you are doing well, I\\'m so happy to have found a crohns friends with the same \"happy to be alive\" feeling that I have. I feel good on this forum being able to talk about my disease without feeling like I\\'m complaining. But I\\'m so happy to be on this earth with my children that I don\\'t like to complain about my crohns. Hi - good to hear you are feeling a tad better and eating a little. You are right to steer clear of steroids. Happily, there are so many new drugs now for Crohn\\'s, it seems to be a question of trial and error to find one that keeps you in remission. Guess I discovered the holy grail when I found mtx on the internet and badgered my then gastro to prescribe it off licence. Take care Li - always happy to share my own experiences with you if I can help at all. Hi Liz, Hope you had a great weekend. Im VERY nervous. So I dont think theres much you can do. Its just living with crohns!! No more corn! Especially processed corn, it destroys your insides by throwing off the natural fatty acid balance. Supplement with fish oil to help with this. When your DR prescribes antibiotics, make sure to take Probiotics to increase healthy micro-flora. Find out where you need nutrients and supplement wisely. Exercise exercise exercise! Seek counseling and find others who have the same troubles and talk about it. Better to get it out than hold in in your stomach! Everyday is a different story and that is frustrating in itself. Its going to take some time to get use to the idea but I believe everything happens for a reason and we arent given more than we can handle...most of the time. I wish the best of luck to everyone and Its not an easy journey but you are a stronger person for doing it. Begin by only eating brown rice and soy yogurt. Make a record of food that make you sick. People think I am crazy but it works. Is there something the Dr. is missing, not giving him, or any other medications out there that work better in these cases? If so I would greatly appreciate some advice. Hi All, I thought I would let some people know what my experiences were. Sorry its not a solution, rather another perspective. Just wondering if ant fellow crohnies out there have had kidney trouble. Sometimes just wish to die, frustrated to the end. I\\'m not one for taking \"Modern or Western medications\"would love to treat this as homeopathically as possible. Any thoughts or words of wisdom from any Crohns Vetrans? Buy aloe vera juice, drink it before bed. Not the sugary drink but the stuff at the health food store. Cut out wheat from your diet....it inflames. Ask your doctors to put you on the steroid treatment and good luck. Buy aloe vera juice, drink it before bed. Not the sugary drink but the stuff at the health food store. Cut out wheat from your diet....it inflames. Ask your doctors to put you on the steroid treatment and good luck. Google wheat and how horrible it is on the body. Go glutten free and cut grains as low as possible. I agree with thr cannibis! What a MIRA CLE!!! Does ANYONE have any remedies, natural therapies, a different medication to suggest, really anything? You may be eating too much fiber, sugar and/or spices. Thank you for the thoughts; I\\'d definitely appreciate any more you might have. Do ask for those. They can make a big difference. need advice,i am thinking about removing j pouch, just wondering if life is any better with out j pouch ,,looking for answers,,,please someone HELP. Maybe you should ask your doctor about those two drugs as well. Cka58 I feel your pain its like a never ending battle with UC. Trudie thats strange you mentioned you felt like you had a blockage after taking Imodium. I always thought it was from that drug as well. If you want to slow down ur bathroom visits i\\'d say take metamucil. Hope everything works out for the best... Have had the bag option in mind, but trying to hold off as long as possible. I am an athlete and this is probably the worst hold back ever. Talk to your doc about xifaxan. I recommend it. It is amazing and never hurts my stomach! I strongly suggest you make some. Also probiotics, aloe Vera capsules, and a multivitamin are good. If you can afford it, go to some yoga classes, get some reiki, and do some meditation. Hope this helps! For better or worse this is me. I try to think of all the things I would have missed altogether without it. Really need some advice and encouragement. Hope to make the change back and eat whatever I want and no longer have to deal with the pain. I wish more Doctors knew about this option to at least give us, their patients more choices. Dr. Ernest Rehnke from the Palms of Pasadena Hospital in St. Petersburg, Florida is an extremely talented surgeon and the staff at the Palms is fantastic. Please at least check into this option and make an informed decision. I\\'m glad I did. Avoid greasy foods! Baked chicken, fish, & turkey are okay. Avoid too many sweets & may sound silly, but chew your food well before swallowing. They want me to see a reuhmatoid doctor, I am wondering if this isn\\'t crohns related,,,any help for a sister would be appreciated. Definitely Chrohn\\'s related. I\\'m reluctant because it means more doctors, and more meds. What a yummy breakfast! i have to take pain killers to feel better and able to work , so don\\'t feel alone i am there with u. I feel for you all, and it seems mostly ladies? The strangest thing is this continuing changing of the area that gives most pain. I am coming to the end of my tether with this, my Doctors keep telling me its to do with the Crohns, we will have to do more tests etc.etc. If the surgery would get rid of the new symptoms while the Crohns stays at bay, great but I am now 54 and not keen on yet more surgery when I feel in myself that this is a seperate issue from the Crohns. There are apparently more than 70 kinds of arthuritis, is it possible that this has nothing to do with the Crohns and should be investigated on its own symptoms? I find if you have Crohns any other ailment at all is lumped in with it, \"Oh that\\'s to do with your Crohns\" is sometimes a very convenient answer. Any help at all would be appreciated, if any one else experienced anything like this or any proffesionals out there have heard of similar symptoms please get in touch through this site or direct to ***@**** Thanks. It\\'s nice to hear that I am not really crazy. Anyway, just wanted to say it\\'s actually good to know that I\\'m really not alone in this craziness. I feel like I\\'m 100 years old. Thanks for letting me vent, and if anyone has any suggestions, I AM WILLING TO TRY ANYTHING AT THIS POINT. Apparently from the bouncing motion. Anyway It seems that there is an infection in me that is either in my colon or in my joints but not at the same time! I don\\'t like taking Tylenol all the time. Hopefully \"if it doesn\\'t kill us, it will make us stronger\". And please , anyone else reading these posts, do the rest of us a favor and post your \"problems\". Until I read about Colitis Arthritis, I thought I was NUTS! I have seen many GI doctors and I think they just love to write prescriptions to keep you quite. To others we look like we\\'re okay, it\\'s hard for them to understand the excrutiating pain we can be in. And I\\'m relieved to discover there is a connection between the two. Don\\'t fall for the \\'raw is best\\' line, hard enough for any body to absorb nutrients from raw veg without a rumen let alone us with absorprtion problems. so i could stand to lose weight. Would love to know if removal of narrowed colon would help ease joint pain... It\\'s miserable. Glad to hear I\\'m not crazy. I\\'d have to travel to have the lapro surgical method but thinking it would be worth it.. I thought I was CRAZY. Hopefully they can help with all this crazy pain. I read this discussion and it could have been parts of my own life!!! I believe I have a very high pain tolerance lol after crohns for this long I\\'ve only been on regular pain meds for the last 4 years. With the gut pain we can get people with crohns develop a high pain tolerance I believe. Anyway not that I wish these problems on anyone but it is nice to hear about them & know a person isn\\'t the only one going through it, especially when (for me at least) the people closest to me really have no idea what it\\'s like. I feel for everyone on this panel and I understand the misery of Crohns, we are not CRAZY, just in constant PAIN. In summary thinks its connected to the Crohn\\'s, somehow? So neither of them are taking any responsibility, they cant both be right unless it is something completely different? I am so so frustrated, I am sure I could handle the pain and disability better if I new what it is and what to expect, I am now unable to work full time or plan anything as I don\\'t know from one day to the next how I am going to be. I don\\'t know the answers, but it does help to speak with people who have an idea what I am going through, so thanks for that at least guys, actually I think mostly ladies on this forum, I feel for you all. Hi, Yes, it\\'s probably all related, because Crohn\\'s and arthritis are both auto-immune conditions, where the body\\'s immune system attacks the body itself. What\\'s really good for joints is green-lipped mussel supplement, freely available. Give that a try, it doesn\\'t seem to irritate the gut. Hey this i think is defiantly crohn\\'s related... Strange they gave me the good old reliable strong one and really messed me up. It\\'s funny our pets get better meds than we do. I just want to make sure of the name of the other, they won\\'t give my wife the same as me so she still suffers, maybe it will work for her too Thank in advance. Please go to the website www.idninfo.org and look up the info. I\\'m so grateful I did. Feeling pretty hopeless but plan to try arthritis medicine like Celebrex if doc agrees. I also feel it must be more than just arthritis. I am only 50 and feel I will have to get on disability soon if I don\\'t get this under control. Try eliminating sugars / Doing so saved my joints. I hope this helps and I highly recommend you try this as it saved me so much pain. Try eliminating sugars / Doing so saved my joints.

I hope this helps and I highly recommend you try this as it saved me so much pain. I am the type of person who is also a worrier and a stresshead at times, so I don\\'t know whether it\\'s to do with that as well. Anyway it would be great if you could let me know. Ask for a hormone test. Your hair loss doesn\\'t have to be a part of the UC. In any case patchy hair loss is a symptom that should be looked into. So you might want to take some. Also it could be hormones like was suggested or it could be a thyroid problem. If you are stressed alot its likely to be that also. You might have some blood work next time you go to the doctor just to rule out all the other stuff mentioned. This does concern me! I think vitamin supplements are worth starting and will do that right away. I have also read articles about lack of iron leading to hair loss - but don\\'t you think my twice daily iron supplement would prevent this? In any case, I would be interested to know if you find something that works and I\\'ll do the same. I\\'m so sad because i feel like i resemble a chemotherapy session patient.I can\\'t do my hair anymore because its like paper thing strings. I\\'m 22 years old and feel 92. My physician told me it was mostly stress (yes, like this is gonna help...anyone with UC knows how stress is hard to control when you\\'re sick and bothered about it!), but my hairdresser aunt actually gave me a great tip - Zinc! It is worth a try at the very least then! Something to think about. I\\'m 25 and this is NOT a side effect of sulfasalazine, so I guess this is just what many uc sufferers have to deal with. So sorry for eveyone\\'s troubles, wish you all the best. Do some research on NSAID\\'s and hair loss. In other words, take vitamins! And if your U.C. is still not under control, ask your doctor about stepping up your treatment to a medication like Imuran (Azathioprine), an immunosuppressant, and go to a bowel disease specialist. I hope it\\'s not permanent. I would suggest assisting your circulation with L-argimine and ginkgo biloba. It can be either and at 7, I would ask a doctor. Take vitamins. It was only a matter of time and not your medicine.'"
